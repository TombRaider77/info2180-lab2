        <p>Game of thrones was a TV series that had an amazing adaptation, however fail to bring the series to a close in a logical manner.  </p>
        <p>When the cast received their lines for the final season they all had a look oh dissapointment, the fans too were dissapointed</p>

        <p>Although Dylan Brooks behaviour was quite unpleasnt during the nba season last year and his performance was unsatisfacoty at least
            this year his play has risen respectfully as it is seen during his reecent perfoirmance in the international basketball
            league. </p>
        <p> This game was the match between the USA and Canda where he scored 39 points against the USA, securing Canads's victory, securing the " Man of the Match"
            title.
